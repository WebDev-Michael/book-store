# Virtual Book Shelf

## App created with React by Michael Wilcox

** The purpose of this app is to practice the use of Axios for API calls. I will be creating a virtual book shelf where a user can sign in and view the books they have on their "shelf".**

### Opening the app

** Upon opening the app, the user is greeted with an onboarding form for creating an account or logging in with an exsisting account. There may be an option in the future for guest use.**

** Once a user has created their account or has logged in to an existing account, they will be able to view the `store` and browse for their favorite books. Once a book has been found, they will have the option to `add to library`, which will add it to their virtual book shelf. **

### The virtual book shelf

** Once the user has selected a few books to add to their virtual book shelf, several options will become available for each title. **

** They will be able to `read` the book and have the current page stored in memory when they close the app and be able to start it up again where they left off. **

** They will have the option to `delete` the book from their library. **

** They will have the option to `favorite` the book and have it show up towards the beginning of their virtual book shelf. **

### The book store

** In the book store, a user can search for books based on `author`, `book title`, `genre`, `category` and a `wishlist` **

### Other

** Other items and/or features may be added during development. **
